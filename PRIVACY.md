Privacy Policy for Media Extractor
----------------------------------

**Last updated:** October 22, 2025

This privacy policy explains the data practices for the "Media Extractor" Chrome Extension (the "Extension").

**1. Data Collection**
We do not collect, store, sell, or transmit any personal information or user data. The Extension is designed to run entirely locally on your computer.

**2. Data Usage**
The Extension's sole purpose is to analyze the user's currently active webpage to find media files (images and videos).

* **Permissions (`activeTab`, `scripting`):** These permissions are used only to execute a script on the page you are currently viewing. This script finds <img> and <video> tags and sends their source URLs to the extension's popup window. This data is never stored and is not sent to any external server.
* **Permission (`downloads`):** This permission is used only to allow the `chrome.downloads` API to save the media files you choose to download from the popup list.

All processing of data (such as media URLs) happens locally within your browser.
